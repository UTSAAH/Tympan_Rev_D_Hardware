D_Tympan_DFMI_1.0 consisits of PCB design files catering to the requirements of Indian PCB Manufacturers. 

The following are the changes done in the PCB design files (.pcb file):  

	1.Four layered board with power/gnd planes as follows:
		Top Cu - GND plane   
		Second layer(In. Cu 1) - None  
		Third layer(In. Cu 2) - 3.3 V power plane  
		Bottom Cu - GND plane  
	2.Details about vias:  
		Through hole vias - 0.6mm/0.4mm  
		Blind vias ( In. Cu 2 - B. Cu) - 0.45mm/ 0.15mm  
	3. Changes in component placement:  
		R20, R23 - Moved from B. Cu to F. Cu layer  
		C14, C20, C21, C22,C34 - Moved from B. Cu to F. Cu layer  


The objectives for design changes in Tympan Rev D, the test results and the outcomes were presented at International HEaring Aid Reserach Conference IHCOn 2022 and the same poster 'IHCON 2022 poster_Dhwani(Tympan DFMI) is uploaded.
